# Arduino projects

List of very simple Arduino projects

## Getting Started
- Requires arduino IDE or web version at [https://create.arduino.cc/editor/](https://create.arduino.cc/editor/)
- It is recommended to use the web version for simplicity

## Usage note
Choose your board (mine is 'Arduino Uno') and configure the serial port. The code listed here cannot be used "as is" as the code highly depends on the circuit connections.
